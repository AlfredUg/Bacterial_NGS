#Bacterial NGS

Background: Acute febrile illness (AFI) refers to the development of fever of short duration as a result of the immune system
responding to the foreign pathogens. Other associated symptoms may include: headaches, dizziness and muscle pain among others.
Diagnosis and treatment of AFI is a major challenge as there are a number of pathogens that can result in very similar 
clinical presentations. Examples of infectious diseases leading to AFI in the tropics include: malaria, dengue, typhoid, 
chikungunya, influenza and viral haemorrhagic fever among others. Studies of AFI conducted using culture-dependent and 
marker-gene techniques across sub-Saharan Africa indicate that the aetiologies of AFI for the different areas may be different.
As such, it is important that treatment choices are derived from evidence obtained for specific populations and metagenomics 
offer a broad spectrum approach to diagnosis.

This study aims at identifying: 

    1. Bacterial pathogens and associated virulence factors.
    2. Bacteriophage associated with undiagnosed AFI. 

250 whole genome sequenced samples are available from undiagnosed patients recruited into the AFI study,
an initiative that aimed to identify causes of AFI of 2-7 days duration in three areas of Uganda. 
Tools for processing and analysis include: FastQC for quality control of sequenced reads, Cutadapt for trimming reads to a
desired base quality threshold, IDBA meta-genome assembler for de novo assembly of the quality trimmed reads, Kraken for 
taxonomic assignment and Diamond for comparing assembled reads to non redundant  NCBI and virulence factor databases. 
Metaphinder for Identifying Bacteriophage Sequences.
